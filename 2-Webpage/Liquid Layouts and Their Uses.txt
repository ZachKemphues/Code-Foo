	Liquid layouts are useful for allowing the contents of a web page to use all of the available window space, while avoiding a horizontal scroll bar.  This allows a single layout to look good for users with a wide variety of screen and window resolutions.  One example of a good use for a liquid layout is a picture gallery.  The page I created uses randomly resized IGN logos to imitate picture thumbnails with various aspect ratios.  A page containing data is also a nice candidate for a liquid layout, because it can allow the user to be presented with all the data, regardless of the window size.  For instance, if IGN wanted to add a page to their reviews that incorporated the Mix'd Reviews scores (with a visual similar to the overlay used in the videos) it would work well with a liquid layout.
