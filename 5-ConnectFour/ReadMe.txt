This is a program that allows the user to play Connect Four against an AI opponent.  Included is an executable .jar file, as well as the source code in a separate folder.

To use it, simply run "ConnectFour.jar" and begin playing.  The human player will always play first and plays with the green pieces.  The computer opponent is purple and will play automatically after the player goes.

Rules of Connect Four:
Connect Four is played on a board with 6 rows and 7 columns.  Players take turns placing pieces.  Pieces can only be placed in the bottom row, or directly above other pieces.  The objective of the game is to have 4 pieces of your color (green) in a line.  A line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  If neither player has made a line by the end of the game it is a draw, otherwise the first player to make a line of 4 pieces (ie. "connect four") wins the game.
